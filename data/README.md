### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. 

The original MID and OVE data are in chinese_pop.zip, classic.zip and ACG.zip. After being transformed into ABC notation, they are saved as ABC_chinesepop.zip, ABC_ACG.zip and ABC_classic.zip. 

The input data are ACG_input.txt, classic_input.txt, chinesepop_input.txt and chinesepop_input.txt, depending on which style users choose.
